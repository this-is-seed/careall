Careall
===================================

### Platform Agenda
We need a system in which elders can make themselves available for care & allocate funds for that. Young folks can earn money monthly by choosing oldies to take care of.

### Technology Used
* Django
* Sql-lite ( Will use postgres while expanding)
* Bootstrap
* Crispy Template Pack

### Features
* Elders can make themselves available for care 
* Young folks can choose oldies to take care of( Atmost 4 ).
* Both types of users have reviews & rating.(To be developed)
* Profile of each user is maintained.

### About Files
There are 2 subapps create

* pools: it conatins the home content and the user management account(for subscribed help management and rating).
* retired : it conatins the user login and profile app related files

Names are quiet abnormal as the names of app donot suggest their work
